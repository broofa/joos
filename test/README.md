# joos unit tests, performance tests, and demos

joostest.js is a small unit testing framework.  There's nothing joos-specific about it, if you want to try using it for your own testing purposes, but there are plenty of other libraries out there that do this sort of thing.

Anyhow, the "test\_*" files here are tests of the joos.js library.

The "demo\_*" files here are functioning demos illustrating how joos can be used.

The "performance\_*" files here are performance tests I've written.  Some of these test joos performance, some test various coding patterns that are used in joos and other libraries for comparison purposes.
